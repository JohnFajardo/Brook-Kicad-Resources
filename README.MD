# Brook KiCad resources for fightstick builders

Brook don't like to share even their dimensional drawings (ironic after illegaly reverse engineering the DualShock and DualSense handshake) so I made this so anyone can build their own PCB's.

These were both tested against a real life UFB and UP5 for correct fit, but feel free to open an issue if you find anything wrong.
